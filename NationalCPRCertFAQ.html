<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <p>You may use either. We encourage you to equip the stations with the type of bags you are utilizing at the facility, but one adult and one pediatric BVM are provided with each cart upon go live, and more may be ordered through <a href="#top">NationalCPRCert support</a>.<br/></p>

<p id="22">
   <b>​What do students struggle most with at the station so I can best coach those needing help?</b></p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <p>Correct technique for BVM is the most common struggle at the station. Emphasize the E-C technique where the little, ring, and middle fingers form an “E” and rest on the mandible and provide chin lift, whereas the index finger and the thumb form a “C” around the mask to provide a tight fit of facemask over patient&#39;s face.</p>​​​ 
   <p>Inability to get enough depth on the chest compression is likely due to not using the step stool.</p>

   <ul>
      <li>The videos within the skills portion of the course provide a quick and focused review of key elements of the skills.</li>
